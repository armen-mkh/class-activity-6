    <p>My favorite animals are definitely dogs. They have mutiple subspecies that have unique personalities but all of
        which are very kind. Dogs are loyal and love to cuddle, two things I look for in a gf.</p>

    <p> However dogs are alot of work and a great responsibility, they become like family instantly. </p>
